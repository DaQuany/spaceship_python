# Overview

This python software is a simple spaceship game. Pygame is used to develop this game. 
I used different functions to creat and move the objects of the game.

A player's spaceship will try to avoid meteors dropping from the top of the game screen.
A player will get more points according to the play time without crashing into meteors.
A player will try to get more points in this game.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I want to be able to fix the moving system. For now the spaceship moves according to the buttons pressed in the past even when a player is not pressing it. I would like to move the spaceship only when I am pressing the buttons
- I want to record the highest scores scored in the game. Using file input and output, I will be able to record and display all the scores.
- I want to be able to randomize the speed of meteors falling from the top. I can apply it to the speed given to each meteors created.
